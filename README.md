# DRAT-Data Mining
### First Data Engineering Project

DRAT is what I named this tool which is just short for "Data Report Anaylsis Tool". The purpose of this code is to webscrape data from a website and return useful information and data models such as graphs and numerical data that could be used to anaylze and solve current issues.
